# GENII Renderer
![Node LTS (16.20)](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v16.20.x-blue)

This project is intended for rendering and testing Genii components, it serves as an example implementation of a react app working with a GENII component. No new features beyond that which have already been added will be accepted in PR.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` or `npm run install`
3. navigate to `localhost:3000`

**NB:** This code uses legacy versions of React, Node and dependencies and as such requires legacy flags to run (these are already defined on the script commands in package.json). I fully intend to update this and companion repositories with modern versions and practices.
